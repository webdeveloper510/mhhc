A flexible, powerful GravityView layout for designers & developers.

== Description ==

DIY is a different kind of View layout: the purpose is to allow designers and developers the most flexibility. DIY allows you to use your own CSS and HTML structure instead of needing to modify our predefined layouts to fit your needs.

== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin files to your plugins folder, or install using WordPress' built-in Add New Plugin installer
2. Activate the plugin
3. Follow the instructions

== Changelog ==
