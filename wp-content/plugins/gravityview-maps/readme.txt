We’re so excited to announce the release of Maps 2.0. [Read the Maps 2.0 announcement blog post](https://www.gravitykit.com/announcing-maps-2-0/). There are so many great new features:

* [Geolocation radius search](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/925-how-to-enable-radius-search) - Users can now search for entries within a certain radius of their current location or a specific location
* [Draggable maps with "Redo search in map" and "Search as map moves"](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/927-search-entries-as-map-moves) - Users can now search using the map itself! Map markers will refresh in real-time as you click and drag the map to different locations.
* [Address field autocomplete](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/926-enabling-autocomplete-for-the-gravity-forms-address-field) - Make it easy for users to enter addresses using address autocomplete. Enable this feature by editing your form and checking the new “Enable geolocation autocomplete” checkbox in the settings of Address fields.
* Faster maps - We’ve rewritten our map rendering to dramatically improve performance

* Added: "International Autocomplete Filter" setting to restrict the countries that are used for address autocomplete
* Modified: Draggable maps functionality requires Views have REST API enabled
* Modified: The "Redo search in map" and "Search as map moves" settings are now enabled by default

__Developer Updates:__

* Added: Wrapping `<div>` surrounds each View, matching the containers in Table and List layouts
* Added: `templates/search-field-geo_radius.php` template file
* Added: Javascript hooks:
	- Filters:
		- `gravitykit/maps/autocomplete_input_id` Modify the input ID used for address autocomplete powered by Google Maps
	- Actions:
		- `gravitykit/maps/autocomplete_field_init` Allows third-party inclusion of actions on initializing the field for auto complete
* Added: PHP hooks:
	- Filters:
		- `gk/gravitymaps/geolocation_fields` - Filter which fields are considered geolocation fields
		- `gravityview/view/wrapper_container` - Modify the HTML wrapper container for the View; [see examples of modifying the container](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/867-modifying-the-view-container-div)
		- `gk/gravitymaps/current_location_instant_search` - Change the default setting for the Current Location behavior: `true` will instantly search when the current location is allowed by the browser and `false` requires users click the submit button (default: false)
* Modified:
	- `templates/fields/entry_map.php` template to fetch existing instance of object for improved performance
	- `templates/map-header.php` and `templates/map-footer.php` files to add the container wrapper (required for draggable maps)
